# Winter internship backend challenge

#### Backend:
* Clone the repo
* ```npm install```
* To obtain the output, run the script ```index.js``` with page_number as the command line argument(since the API is paginated, we need to include the page number as a query param for the API endpoint).
* For example, run

```node index.js 3``` will set the page_number argument to 3,  

```node index.js 2``` will set the page_number argument to 2,

```node index.js``` will have the page argument as '1' by default.
